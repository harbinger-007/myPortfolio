      <div class="about-me">
      <h3>Based in Oregon. With no background in computer science or technical backgrounds, nor being able to afford any website builders such as Squarespace and Wix, I started to teach myself web developing. Over the time, as I teach myself, my journey as an aspiring web developer had begun.
          <br>
          <br>
        When I am not building anything, I would take part in doing leisurely activites such as art, video games, and exercise.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
        I believe in having a growth mindset, from where I stand, I strive to continue to get to know myself even better in the future standpoint.
